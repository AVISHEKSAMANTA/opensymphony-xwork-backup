<h3><a name="1.0.1PressRelease-NewFeatures"></a>New Features</h3>
<p>The biggest addition to XWork is the new ObjectFactory which allows for tight integration to other projects such as Spring and Pico. Not only that, the ObjectFactory is very useful to integrate XWork in to your existing project infrastructure. Documentation (both reference manuals and JavaDocs) have been greatly improved as well.</p>

<h3><a name="1.0.1PressRelease-BugFixes"></a>Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>There have been several important bug fixes, the most important is a performance-related bug fix that makes the expression language magnitudes faster. This also solved an extremely rare problem where some applications would lock up.</p>

<h3><a name="1.0.1PressRelease-SpecialThanks"></a>Special Thanks</h3>
<p>Special thanks go out to Bill Lynch of <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com" title="Visit page outside Confluence">Jive Software</a> for helping with all the added JavaDocs. Mark Woon has also done a superb job assisting with bug fixes, new features, and documentation. </p>

<h3><a name="1.0.1PressRelease-AboutXWork"></a>About XWork</h3>

<p>XWork is a generic command pattern implementation and inversion of control (IoC) container. It is designed to be small, fast, and fit specifically for workflow-related usages, such as web application frameworks and workflow engines. WebWork provides the foundation for <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork" title="Visit page outside Confluence">WebWork</a>, a Java-based web framework. </p>

<p>Besides WebWork, you can find integration support in <a href="http://www.opensymphony.com/osworkflow" title="Visit page outside Confluence">OSWorkflow</a> and <a href="http://www.jpublish.org/" title="Visit page outside Confluence">JPublish</a>.</p>

<p>Core features include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Command pattern implementation</li>
	<li>Interceptor support allowing you to provide tight application integration</li>
	<li>Inversion of Control framework, helping you manage complex component dependencies</li>
	<li>Decoupled validation framework, letting you focus on disconnecting input validation from core business logic</li>
	<li>Extremely fast and flexible expression language based off of <a href="http://www.ognl.org" title="Visit page outside Confluence">OGNL</a></li>
	<li>Advanced type conversion support, allowing you to never have to write data conversion code inside of your core business objects</li>
</ul>
